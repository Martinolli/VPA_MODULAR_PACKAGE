    "content": "A Selling Climax is a critical concept in Volume Price Analysis and the Wyckoff method. It occurs at the end of a downtrend, where there's a significant increase in volume as a substantial decline in price takes place. This indicates panic selling, where sellers rush to exit positions, often leading to a sharp fall in price. \n\nThe Selling Climax typically suggests that a market bottom may be near as the excessive selling exhausts itself. Smart money or informed buyers often step in at this point, seeing value in the lower prices, which leads to a stabilization or even reversal of the price trend. This phase is usually followed by the \"Automatic Rally,\" a bounce off the lows as selling pressure decreases.\n\nIf you observe a Selling Climax, it might signal a potential buying opportunity, but it's crucial to wait for confirming signals like a change in trend direction or a higher low to validate the transition from a bearish to a bullish environment."
